 	<h1> Call for Volunteers to help in the FAWPS donation and charity works drive.</h1>
	<p> This campaign was initiated to help the flood victims and to protect our environment by helping around the Philippines and their areas to donate flood relief goods and protection systems to those who live in flood prone areas. </p>
	<p> WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN THIS CAMPAIGN? </p> 
	<p> 1. Helping those in need and those who are less fortunate with less resources available in case of emergencies. </p>
	<p> 2. Learning more about the experiences of those who were affected by the flood and more about natural disasters. </p>
	<p> 3. Protect our environment and help it become more sustainable and less affected by such natural disasters. </p>
